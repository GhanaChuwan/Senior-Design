# Academic Performance and Success App
The goal of the project is to develop a functional iOS and Android mobile application that can help nursing students keep track of their academic performance. Despite the resources and support provided, some students in the nursing program at Penn State Behrend are struggling to complete the required degree-related credits. Miscommunication between professors and program administrators has made it difficult to identify the root cause of these issues, leading to a lack of effective support for students. Penn State Behrend's nursing department is creating an application for nursing students to track their study time on homework and exams. The application will help students assess whether they are dedicating enough time to each topic and allow the program to monitor their progress, identify areas of struggle, and provide support accordingly.
